# 5210-Terrain-Gen
Cellular automata and tile based terrain generation with tile destruction written for a university group project.

This project was written for a group project which involved several members working to create a game. I was in charge of the levels, and opted to implement cellular automata instead of manually constructing the levels. The game consists of a player with several guns that can defeat enemies, and 2 different levels with different generation and tile types. A map class is also included.

The files in this repository are those written by me, not the full project.
